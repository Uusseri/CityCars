# CityCars


## Summary

The idea of the project is a city where transportation is primarily handled using only self-driving taxis. Using artificial intelligence, the system optimizes the locations of cars so that there are always the right number in the right place throughout the year, at all times of day, and taking into events, holidays, and other factors. This ensures that taxis are available to users efficiently and as needed.


## Background

This would solve several different problems. I live in the city myself, and these problems personally affect me. Car traffic in the city would decrease significantly because fewer cars would be needed. Currently, privately owned cars idel for most of their lifespan in their owners' yard, rather than being used by others who need them. When cars are continuously available to everyone, significantly fewer cars are needed. This would also reduce traffic jams, making traffic faster, decreasing noise from cars, and improving the cityâ€™s air quality. Taxis also provide a more flexible mode of transportation compared to other public transit forms, as they do not have schedules or specific stops. When all taxis operate within the same system and communicate with each other, the risk of accidents can be significantly minimized.


## How is it used?

The system's users would be all people living in the city. This would be their primary mode of transportation, as no other public transit would be needed. There would also be various types of cars available to meet different needs and requirements.


## Data sources and AI methods

This would require a lot of different data sources to track users' car demand and other related factors. This could include historical taxi data, users' location information, and residential area data. Additionally, information about various events, holidays, and weather conditions would be needed. These data could then be utilized with machine learning.


## Challenges

There are many challenges for a system like this. Building such a system would be very expensive and would require legislative support. The safety of self-driving cars is still a significant concern. The technology must be sufficiently mature and reliable to operate on a large scale. Additionally, no system is completely immune to security vulnerabilities, so the risk of cyberattacks is also high. A cyberattack could disrupt the life of an entire city. Data protection legislation may also pose challenges, as the system would require extensive data, including users' location information. Furthermore, public acceptance of such a solution may not yet be very high.


## What next?

Next, the project could expand to operate in multiple cities and collaborate with other modes of transportation, such as trains, airplanes, and buses, across cities. The service could also be expanded by offering various options in vehicles, such as luxury cars and vehicles for people with disabilities. More precise methods for collecting user data could be developed to predict the demand for cars at specific times and places. Users could be offered incentives such as free rides in exchange for sharing their data.
